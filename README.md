# Genetic Disease Predictor

## Overview

Genetic Disease Predictor is a web-based application that uses machine learning to predict the risk of five major genetic diseases based on clinical and genetic parameters. The platform also provides educational resources, a disease explorer, and a contact form for user support.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure signup, login, and logout using Supabase.
- **Disease Risk Prediction:** ML-powered risk assessment for Thalassemia, Hemophilia, Breast Cancer, Sickle Cell Anemia, and Cystic Fibrosis.
- **Disease Explorer:** Browse detailed information about genetic diseases.
- **Contact Form:** Users can send messages to the support team.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS for modern, mobile-friendly design.

## Modules

### 1. `app.py`
Main Flask application. Handles routing, form processing, model inference, user session management, and rendering templates.

- **Routes:**
  - `/login`, `/signup`, `/logout`: User authentication.
  - `/`: Home page (requires login).
  - `/diseases`: Disease explorer.
  - `/disease/<id>`: Disease detail.
  - `/predict`: Disease risk prediction form and results.
  - `/contact`: Contact form.

- **Model Loading:** Loads `disease_predictor_model.pkl` using `joblib`.
- **Session Management:** Uses Flask session for user state.

### 2. `models.py`
Handles user management and Supabase integration.

- **Supabase Client:** Initialized using credentials from `.env`.
- **User Class:** Methods for creating users, logging in, fetching user data, and logging out.
- **Contact Messages:** Stores contact form submissions in Supabase.

### 3. Templates (`templates/`)
HTML templates rendered by Flask using Jinja2.

- `base.html`: Layout and navigation.
- `home.html`: Landing page.
- `login.html`, `signup.html`: Authentication forms.
- `predict.html`: Prediction form and results.
- `disease_explorer.html`: List of diseases.
- `disease_detail.html`: Disease details.
- `contact.html`: Contact form.

### 4. Static Files (`static/`)
- **main.js:** Custom JavaScript for UI interactions (e.g., mobile menu).
- **Tailwind CSS & FontAwesome:** Loaded via CDN for styling and icons.

### 5. Model File
- `disease_predictor_model.pkl`: Trained RandomForest model for disease prediction.

### 6. Environment File
- `.env`: Stores Supabase URL and API key.

## Libraries Used

- **Flask:** Web framework for Python.
- **joblib:** For loading the ML model.
- **numpy, pandas:** Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **supabase-py:** Python client for Supabase (database and authentication).
- **werkzeug:** Utilities for WSGI applications (used by Flask).
- **dotenv:** Loads environment variables from `.env`.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **FontAwesome:** Icon library.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration/Login:** Users create accounts and log in via Supabase authentication.
2. **Disease Prediction:** Users enter clinical/genetic data. The backend normalizes inputs and predicts disease risk using the ML model.
3. **Disease Explorer:** Users browse genetic diseases and view detailed information.
4. **Contact:** Authenticated users can send messages to the support team, stored in Supabase.
